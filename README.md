# Lab: 08 - OO Design and GSON
## Overview
In this lab I use the file **recentquotes.json** to show random popular book quotes and show the author.
## Methods and Library
* Used **GSON** library to parse the **json** file.
* **`FileReader`** : FileReader is meant for reading streams of characters. For reading streams of raw bytes.
*  **`BufferedReader`** : It is a class from Java I/O classes, and it used for readind a text data from files line by line.
